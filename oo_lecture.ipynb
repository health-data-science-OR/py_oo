    "\n",
    "* That we have been using classes all the way through the course!\n",
    "* How to instantiate multiple instances of a class.\n",
    "* How to declare a class and define a class constructor method.\n",
    "* What is meant by class attributes and methods.\n",

    "> It is worth noting that in python you don't have to use classes you can actually achieve everything with functions.  However, the abstraction benefits of OO are really important for the design and organisation of complex projects."

    "Back in the late 80s and early 90s a popular type of game on micro-computers, such as the **Commodore 64** and **ZX Spectrum**, was the **text adventure**. These were games where a player had to navigate and solve puzzles in a game world with only text descriptions of locations as their guide!\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of games lend themselves nicely to abstraction offered in object orientated methods of design (and python command line interfaces).  For example, in a very simple implementation we could have a class of type `Game` that accepts a limited number of commands (for example, \"n\" to represent 'go north' or \"look\" to represent 'look and describe the room'.).  The `Game` would encapsulate one or more `Room` objects that describes a location and contain exits to other `Room` objects.  \n",
